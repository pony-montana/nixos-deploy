My nixos simple machine deploy, started tweaking from
https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos I actually dont understand why most of the
things work here but they actually works.

These for now are my sort-of nixfiles that serve me as a backup, at some point
could turn this repo into a battery-included nixos deployment...
